Inspiration

I work as a certified peer health educator focusing on mental health for the Health and Wellness Resource Center on campus. I am passionate about creating awareness in my community regarding mental health where people can understand their emotions better and perform well in real-life. According to a survey in SAMSHA report, nearly 25% of college students suffered from mental issues from 2018. Moreover, that was pre-covid times. Further social isolation caused by Covid 19 have made this problem more serious. Thus, it is necessary for college students to understand their emotions and become more emotionally aware which is a necessary skill not only for career growth but also to have fulfilling relationship with other people.

What it does

The application helps user to express their emotions and understand them. The user have 2 ways to express himself: he can either chat or can have speak . After this choice, have multiple ways to choose on how he wants to interact with the application: select from a list of written emotions, write something else and even a choice to take selfie and being automatically detected the emotion. To be more inclusive to diverse community, there is an option to select the language the user feel comfortable and then interact with the application.

How we built it
I started with the frontend of the application. I chose react-native because I was familiar with it and have used it in other personal projects. For the server side, I used Spring Boot.

Challenges we ran into
Tried setting up the backend in Spring Boot but was facing issues in integrating it with Gemini AI.

Accomplishments that we’re proud of
I am proud of creating a working frontend for the application that is scalable and user friendly. Also, the application supports different languages like Hindi, Punjabi, English and Spanish , making it an inclusive application that can be used by divserse community. The design of the application is scalable which makes it easy to incorporate other languages.

What we learned
Through this Hackathon, I was able to develop more ideas in a field for which I truly care - Health care. I have upskilled myself in React Native and tried using Gemini AI APIs. Thus, I have been able to get in touch with using generative AI APIs which is quite recent development in the field of Computer Science.

What’s next for Self Heal Mobile Application
The next part would be to set up a backend which uses generative ai APIs. Initially I was planning to Gemini AI, but with more time, I would do a holistic research on different models available and which one produces the most accurate results. Since people disclosing their emotions is a very big step, we cannot afford to have responses that does not align in helping the user.
